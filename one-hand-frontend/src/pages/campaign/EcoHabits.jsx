          provide, the better I can tailor my writing to accurately reflect you.

          Fuelled with enthusiasm, Smile’s founders gave a shape to their dream, and Smile Foundation was born. Over the last
          two decades, Smile has evolved as a sustainable Indian social institution – committed to do real work on the ground,
          and make the society and businesses inclusive in the process of bringing change.

          On our way, we had to make many difficult choices and constantly innovate – whether it was choosing to work on the
          ground or working to bring change from within.
